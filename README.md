## Updates
Here are all the improvements compared to the previous version:

1. **Sleeker Design**: 40% thinner than the first version for a more compact look.
2. **Tool-Free Assembly**: SnapFit design allows for easy assembly without tools.
3. **Less Wiring Hassle**: A custom PCB simplifies assembly and reduces soldering.
4. **Simplified Controls**: No extra buttonsâ€”everything is controlled via the rotary encoder.
5. **New Video**: A detailed walkthrough of the new version! Watch here: [Clone Thing Made Easier](https://youtu.be/O8BWIcywnc4)

## Driver Setup
For the display to work properly, we need to configure the drivers too:

1. For Windows: Navigate to "Documents\Arduino\libraries\TFT_eSPI" and edit User_Setup_Select.h.
    1a. For MacOS: Navigate in Finder to ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/TFT_eSPI.
2. Comment the default library adding "//" in front of the #, then uncomment #include <User_Setups/Setup18_ST7789.h>. Save and exit.
    2a. If you are using a different display, then uncomment the setup related to that IC (eg. #include <User_Setups/Setup2_ST7735.h>)
3. Navigate to "Documents\Arduino\libraries\TFT_eSPI\User_Setups" and edit Setup18_ST7789.h
4. Uncomment '#define TFT_RGB_ORDER TFT_RGB' and comment out #define TFT_RGB_ORDER TFT_BGR
5. OPTIONAL: If your display is showing inverted colors consider switching between #define TFT_INVERSION_ON or #define TFT_INVERSION_OFF, also in the Clone_thing.ino file try swaping TJpgDec.setSwapBytes(true); with TJpgDec.setSwapBytes(false);
6. The drivers should be ready, have fun with your very Own-Clone Thing.

### You can also just replace the drivers with the files provided in the repo
